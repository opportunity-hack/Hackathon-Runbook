This is currently a work in progress.  I'm just getting it into Docusaurus, so it's a hot mess.

# Hackathon-Runbook

This is my first pass at creating a runbook of my/our thoughts on how to run Opportunity Hack.  There are a few caveats:
* Opportunity Hack has been run in a few different formats.  This runbook focuses on the full weekend varieties run in the US.  
* Even though we've gotten pretty good at these, there is always room for improvement, and we tune things every year.
  * Tuning is is not completely re-examining.

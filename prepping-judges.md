title: Prepping the Judges
---
Most of the time, this will be the first time your judges have judged at Opportunity Hack.  For many of them it's likely to even be the first time they'd been judges.  So, you need to give them some preparations to get the best possible outcomes.

## Arrival Time

Have them arrive an hour before judging is expected to begin.  This allows you to get them all together so that you only have to talk to them once.  In reality, you don't need an hour, but it's likely a few of them will be a few minutes late, so you want to give yourself time to do this job right.

## Supplies

Every judge should get a few basic items:
*  Judging scoresheets (which can be found on the [master spreadsheet](resources/resources.md))
*  Writing utensil
*  Hard surface to write on (i.e. clip board)
*  Water (they're talking a lot, so bottled water is a great idea)

## Location

Have a separate room reserved and dedicate for the judges.  This room will be used for the briefing, a place for them to leave their stuff, and a common area to come back to for the judging discussion.  Ideally you want this room to have a large monitor that you can project the results onto for the discussion.

## Pre-Judging

This is your opportunity to ensure everyone is on the same wavelength.  I'm getting tired of writing all of this down, so now you're going to get a list of things that I think you should go over, but not a lot of explanation.  Maybe a future edit will change this.

*  Thank you for coming.  Can't do this without you.
*  Brief overview of the goals of Opportunity Hack
*  Go through all of their supplies and ensure they all verify they have what they need
*  Go over the judging criteria
*  Show the part of the presentation on that the hackers saw (again, it's in [resources](resources/resources.md)) on what they should demo and how
*  Tell them to make sure they are consistent from first to the last.  We can adjust for differences between them.
*  Scoring
  *  Integers
  *  You have the whole range.  Use it.  Don't use a 0,8,9,10 on a 10 point scale.
  *  Fill out your sheet after every demo.  Hand it to your runner.
*  Runners
  *  Each of you will have at least one runner.  Their jobs are to:
     *  Have you on a timer so you don't go over
     *  Help you navigate from team to team
     *  Get your scoresheet back to score central
*  When you are done with judging, return to the judging room

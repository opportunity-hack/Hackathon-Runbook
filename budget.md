You need to understand how much money you have to work with.  Typically, the three largest costs are:

* Prizes
* Food
* SWAG (should include T-shirts)

Additionally you might have costs for:

* Venue (the location)
* Venue (staffing)

Even if you can get the venue for free, you often have to pay for cleaning or security for the event.  One way to offset this cost is to make the venue one of the sponsors.

**Note:** There is a sample budget linked from the [Resources](resources/resources.md) page, or you can check out the [budget tab on the Google sheet directly](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UA896TJE1BFBNs3cf81oUJY0YodGAbyKZxQAMRJs9RI/edit).

## Prizes

Money.  It's the first thing that people are going to be interested in.  However, since your goal is to provide completed solutions, you're going to want to award it in two chunks.  

* ~20% at the end of the hackathon
* Remainder when the project is implemented

The prize money is necessary, but the amounts have varied.  The two that we've used in the US are:

* $6000, $3000, $2000
* $3000, $2000, $1000

## Food

Need to fill this in more, but make sure that you consider special needs diets.  In particular, veg and vegan.  

## SWAG

:::note

This is also more fully detailed in [SWAG](swag).

The only thing I can really think of that you need to have is t-shirts.  This is a way to build your brand over time, and it's something people like a lot.  You'll want to make sure you have good shirts, because it really makes a difference and the cost differential is small.  These also have a decent lead time if you want to make sure you can get all the sizes, so you want to have your order in 6-8 weeks before the event.

Other than that, it's really up to you.  Things that we've done over time that I think work well:
* Prepackaged overnight kits (toothbrush, mouthwash, eyemask, etc )
* Water bottles (so they can refill them and because you never have enough water)

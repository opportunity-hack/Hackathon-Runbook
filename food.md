One of the primary ways to make your hackathon successful is to ensure that everyone is well fed, but it can be tricky.  Various special requests percentages do tend to vary by location, so we'll provide some guidelines.  You'll want to provide a variety of different styles of food just to keep it interesting.

## Guidelines

You need to plan for various dietary restrictions.  In general you should expect something like the following:

*  33% vegetarian
*  A couple of vegans
*  Allergies: A few, but varied enough you can't actually plan for it

**Note:** You can find some of the data behind these suggestions in the [food section of the resources page](resources/resources.md#Food)

## Equipment

You need a plan for making drinks cold.  This means you need:
* Coolers
* A plan for replenishing ice

Generally, having three (3) coolers would probably work best.

*  Cooler 1: Water
*  Cooler 2: Energy drinks
*  Cooler 3: Soda/gatorade/misc

## Snacks

We generally handle this with a Costco order.  You can order ahead and have it delivered to your venue.

I'll have to dig out what the Costco orders are to fill this in.

My one caveat is that it seems like you can never have enough water.


## Meals

### Breakfast on opening morning

*  Timing:  0800 
Make it something portable and easy.  Allows people to mill around and feel good about the opening of the program.

### Lunch

*  Timing: Noon


### Dinner

*  Timing:  1800 (aka 6:00 p.m.)

### Ice cream 

Why not continue to fatten them up with something fat and sweet?  Again, just something different and a good way to breakup the evening.

*  Timing: 2100 (aka 9:00 p.m.)

### Midnight pizza

*  Timing:  I'm going to make you guess

### Breakfast Day 2

*  Timing: 0800

### Lunch Day 2

*  Timing: 1130.  You want this to be a bit earlier so you're not interfering with crunch time


## Things that have worked well for meals

* Build your own potato bar
* Using two food trucks for one of the meals

This is likely going to involve some compromise, simply due to what the ideal venue would look like.

* Free
* A lot of individual rooms with
  * Comfortable seating
  * A lot of power outlets
  * Whiteboards 
* An ampitheatre
* Bathrooms
* Locker rooms & showers
* Great parking
* A brewery within short walking distance
* Janitorial staff
* Kitchen with refrigerators and freezers
* Great wifi

I'm sure there is more, but even just "free" means you're into compromises.

## Must haves
This is what you absolutely **have to** have.

* A facility that is safe 
* Someplace able to be open around the clock.  This is often the thing people don't understand.
* Enough outlets that you can string power strips to
* Wifi
* Bathrooms

Everything else can be managed.

## What's a good venue?
A good venue is one that has a staff that is happy to have you there.  It will make everything after that easier.

* Enough space for people to spread out.  
  Teams are going to want space from each other, but still be able to cluster around.  You want tables to be available so that they can congregate around the tables to work.
  Having small or medium rooms where one or more teams can be clustered helps to break that up.
* A central demonstration/presentation space.  
  This is where initial presentations will be done and where final presentations can be done.  Big enough to have all the participants in one place.  Ideally with audio/visual (AV) capabilities, but you can always rent that if you have to.
* A central area for food.
  This is where you can have snacks and drinks out and be a single place that you can serve all the meals from.
* Wifi that isn't restricted.
  This is sometimes a problem with corporate wifi.  Especially for companies who don't really understand how security works, but instead just block ports because they think it helps prevent 133t h4ck3rZ.
* Parking.
  Enough parking on-site or nearby for people to not have to worry about hw they're going to get there and home again.

## What's a great venu?
* Amphitheatre with A/V
* Central kitchen with refrigerators and freezers
* add more

## Where to look?
* Companies
  One of your partner/sponsor companies is likely the best place to source a location because they'll be automatically engaged.
* Co-working spaces
  These tend to be well connected with the community and are well setup for the hacking portion
* College facilities
  These can definitely work.  They take more planning, but if you're working with student organizations anyway, normally reasonably inexpensive.
* Hotel conference centers
  This generally doesn't work.  They are expensive and not well equipped to handle around-the-clock.  Additionally, they tend to want you to use their catering, which is even more expensive.
